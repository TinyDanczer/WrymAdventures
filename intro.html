                Hello, welcome to a website all about special edition books. Mostly I will focus on subscription book boxes that feature exclusive special editions of books. First off to any of 
                our unfamiliars let me answer what a book box subscription is. They are a subscribtion box that speaclizes in everything bookish. Typically most boxes are monthly, although some
                are bi-monthly or quarterly. There are various generes covered in these boxes. However, must usually specilaizes in specific generes. Some boxes only feature just a speacial edition 
                book where as some offer additional bookish merch. The bookish merch can vary widely, but they always feature items releated to other books or the one included in the box. Depending on
                the type, monthly, Bi-monthly, or quarterly,of book box you subscribe to is how often you can expect a book. Typically you are given a theme prior to the month with a handful of hints.
                This keeps what book you are getting a surprise. Some book companies will spoil and allow their subs to know the author and book prior. Some don't spoil. However if you do prefer to
                know which books to expect I have found theautumnbookreads on instagram has exceelent guesses. I have yet to see her guesses as inncorrect.

            <h1>What makes a special edition book?</h1>
            <p class="info">
                Well to be plain and simple, they are exclusively designed books made differently then original prints released to the entire public. Special editions usually have
                many different features to them. Such as signatures(digtal, or hand), sprayed, or digitally printed edges, exclusive art on the end pages, exclusively designed cover art 
                on both the hard cover, and dustjacket, reversible dustjackets, exclusivey formatted chapter headers, bound in extras, like art or letters from the authors,
                and lets not forget exclusive accentings like foiling. I'm sure I am missing a few, but you get the idea. If these sort of things interest you stick around and take a little
                wyrm's adventure to the other pages.
